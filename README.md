# Orthogonal-Array-Cache-Distribution-Treaps
ðŸš€ Python implementation of the Orthogonal Array Cache Distribution Treap (OACDT), a novel data structure for scalable, fault-tolerant distributed caching. Combines Orthogonal Arrays for uniform load balancing and Treaps for efficient O(log n) operations.
